An excerpt from [his homepage](http://people.llnl.gov/pdbarnes):


> Dr. Peter D. Barnes, Jr. joined the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in September 1996 as a Post-Doctoral Researcher in particle physics. Since then he has helped develop, operate, and/or led several particle physics experiments, including the MINOS neutrino oscillation experiment at Fermilab and Minnesota, and the MIPP particle production experiment at Fermilab. He also worked on proton radiography, an application of particle physics techniques to diagnosing material behavior in dynamic experiments driven by high explosives. 

> Recently Dr. Barnes has been working on various aspects of cyber security. He currently leads the Network Simulation team, which is developing tools to simulate realistic computer networks, with realistic traffic models, at scale, meaning 10,000-10,000,000 simulated computers. With colleagues and collaborators at RPI, Dr. Barnes, recently set a pair of world records in discrete event simulation: achieving 504 billion simulation events per second, utilizing 7,864,320 MPI tasks on 1,966,080 compute cores.

> Dr. Barnes earned a B.S. in Physics from Yale University in 1987, and a M.S. (1990) and Ph.D. in Physics from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1996. His thesis research designed and built the first cryogenic dark matter detector (CDMS), which operated at the Stanford University Underground Facility. The successor, CDMS II, still operates at the Soudan Underground Research Laboratory in Tower, Minnesota. Dr. Barnes is the author of over 90 publications.
