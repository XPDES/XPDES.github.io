Dr. David Jefferson is a computer scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory where he does research in supercomputing and cybersecurity. He has been working in the field of parallel discrete event simulation off and on for 30 years, and is best known as the co-inventor of Time Warp and the family of optimistic methods of parallel discrete event simulation. Currently he is working on Backstroke, a project for automatically generating reverse code for optimistic simulations written in C++.  With Peter Barnes and Chris Carothers he recently set a world record for both speed (504 billion events/sec) and scale (almost 8 billion MPU tasks) in a single discrete event simulation benchmark run on the Sequoia supercomputer. In his spare time Dr. Jefferson is also an internationally known expert in election security.
