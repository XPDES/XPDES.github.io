Markus Schordan is a computer scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC)). His research interests include program analysis and verification, reverse code generation, programming languages for high-performance computing, and compiler construction. The software systems of interest are specific HPC applications and large-scale software systems in general. The reverse code generation is of interest for optimistic parallel discrete event simulation systems.

 In 2009 he received an R&D 100 AWARD (ROSE), in 2011 a Best Paper Award at the 11th IEEE Source-Code and Manipulation Conference (SCAM 2011), in 2012 and 2013 the Method Combination Award in the RERS Challenges (overall 3rd and 2nd respectively), and in 2014 he won the RERS 2014 Challenge (overall 1st). 

He received a Diploma Degree in computer science from TU Vienna in 1997, and a PhD degree from University Klagernfurt in 2001 (with distinction). He is author or co-author of 30+ refereed and invited papers of conferences and journals.

He has served as co-organizer of ISoLA 2014 Track "Evaluation and Reproducibility of Program Analysis", GPUScA 2011, GPUScA 2010, Dagstuhl Seminar No. 08161, ISoLA'08 Track: Formal Methods for Analysing and Verifying Very Large Systems, and EuroPar'03 Topic 04: Compilers for High-Performance. He served as program committee member of several conferences, most recently Euro-Par 2015, SOFSEM 2015, ISoLA 2014, SYNASC 2014, SYNASC 2013, ARW 2013.
