# Discrete Event Simulations: will they ever be parallelized effectively?

Parallel and distributed discrete event simulations are used to predict and analyze the behavior of complex systems in a wide variety of domains, including supercomputers, telecommunication networks, transportation, electrical power grids, propagation of contagions over populations, manufacturing and logistics, and so on.
Although large systems are almost always computationally challenging to simulate, parallelizing such simulations on supercomputers has proved to be even more challenging due to issues such as temporal synchronization, load balancing, challenges in developing scalable parallel codes, etc.
Distributed and embedded distributed simulations interacting with physical systems in real-time present a host of additional, new issues. 
This panel, which includes many stalwarts who started the parallel and distributed simulation (PADS) field decades ago, will discuss the current state of art, and projections for the future in this area.
