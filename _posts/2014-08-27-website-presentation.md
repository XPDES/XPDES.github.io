# Current Status

- Built Using Simple [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) Format
- Static Site Generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
- Beatiful and Simple [Hyde Theme](http://hyde.getpoole.com/)

## Content

- Currently missing some [people](/people)
- Need more details on associated [software](/software)

## Docmentation

The small protion of documentation needed for the site will sit in the README.md file.
This file is automatically parsed by GitHub, and will explain how other members can contribute to the website.

# To Do

## Logo

Is there a graphic or masthead we would like to associate with XPDES?
Maybe branding colors and a certain font?

## Deployment

The site will be quickly deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
GitHub offers free webpage hosting, including custom domain name configuration. 
GitHub Pages are easy to create, and this website will be under the control of the [GitHub/XPDES](https://github.com/xpdes) group.
Although the code is open source, only group members are allowed to commit to the repository.

## Domain Name

A simple CNAME file needs to be added to the repository and DNS must be setup to work with GitHub.
Then we will be up and running!
